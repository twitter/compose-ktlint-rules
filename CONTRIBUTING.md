# How to Contribute

We'd love to get patches from you!

## Building the Project

```shell
./gradlew build
```

Running the build task will make sure to compile the code, run all the tests and pass all the linters necessary.

## Workflow

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a feature branch
3. Write code and tests for your change
4. Make sure the code builds and all the linters pass before submitting your changes.
5. From your branch, make a pull request against the main repo (`twitter/compose-rules`)
6. Work with the repo maintainers to get your change reviewed
7. Wait for your change to get merged into the `main` branch in the main repo.

# Bug reports

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

1. Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.
2. Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest main branch in the repository.
3. Isolate the problem — ideally create a reduced test case and a live example.
4. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Include specific information about the environment - Kotlin version, Jetpack Compose version and steps required to reproduce the issue.

# Twitter's Jetpack Compose Rules

A big challenge to face when a big team with a large codebase starts adopting Compose is that not everybody will start at the same page. This happened to us at Twitter.

Compose is üîù, allows for amazing things, but has a bunch of footguns to be aware of. [See the thread](https://twitter.com/mrmans0n/status/1507390768796909571).

This is where these static checks come in. We want to detect all the potential issues even before they reach the code review state, and foster a healthy Compose adoption.

Check out the project website for more information: https://twitter.github.io/compose-rules

## Static checks for Compose bundled in this repo

The comprehensive list of what these rules will check for is in [the rules documentaton](https://github.com/twitter/compose-rules/blob/main/docs/rules.md). It contains both what we check for and why are we doing that, so giving it a good read is encouraged.

## Using the custom ruleset with ktlint

### With ktlint-gradle

If using [ktlint-gradle](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh/ktlint-gradle), you can specify the dependency on this set of rules by using the `ktlintRuleset`.

```groovy
dependencies {
    ktlintRuleset "com.twitter.rules.compose:ktlint:<VERSION>"
}
```

### With spotless

If using [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless), there is currently a workaround on how to do that described [in this issue](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/issues/1220).
